Hello! My name is Corissa Peck.

Some things to know about me.

* I started in dev and moved to testing - BECAUSE I LOVE IT.
* I’ve been writing and testing software professionally since I was 19. My first job was as a contract employee working for the US Army – writing COBOL.
* I am a believer in the Principle of Modern Testing and want to see a world where we don’t separate coding and testing into different camps.

THIS IS RANI.  I got the amazing opportunity to vist my team in India this month and recruited this pretty girl as our newest member. She seems smart and teachable,  but her coding skills are rudimentary at best.
