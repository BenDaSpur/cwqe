I'm Rebecca Petersen.  I've been doing Quality Engineer for the last couple of years.  

I love exploratory testing and the chance to just explore around code.  

In my free time I enjoy video games, but I can be difficult to play with because my "exploratory testing" side tends to come out in gameplay. :)
