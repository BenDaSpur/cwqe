This site is dedicated to a simple idea. How can a few people spread quality _recipes_ to others.

What is a recipe? We like to think that it can be two things. One is a literal recipe for some food that we really enjoy, and the other is recipes for creating the best environment for quality engineers and the development team to thrive!

So stay tuned because we have some really fun ideas of what we would love to share with you!
