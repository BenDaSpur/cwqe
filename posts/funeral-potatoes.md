Funeral potatoes are a hard recipe to nail down.  For me,  cooking in general can be a little more like Exploratory testing than scripted testing.  I have a basic idea of how something should work and then go and feel my way through it.

This was a very requested recipe after our last potluck.  The day before quarantine for covid-19 started.

So,  here is the best way I know how to describe how to make Funeral Potatoes.

**Ingredients:**

Amounts are approximate

* 1 small onion,  diced (about 1 cup)
* 8 TBS Butter - divided (4/4)
* 2 bouillon cubes - My family is vegetarian so I used Not Chick'N brand bouillon cubes. 
* 1 tsp garlic powder
* 1/4 ish tsp black pepper
* 1/2 cup flour
* 2 cups milk
* 1 cup sour cream
* 2 cups cheddar jack cheese
* 30 oz frozen hash-browns - shreds or cubed

First - saute the onion in 4 TBS butter.  Add the boullion, garlic powder and black pepper.

Next - Add the flour and combine to make a paste.   You're basically making a Roux at this point. This always looks kind of wrong to me.  It's fine!  I promise!

Mix the milk and sour cream and add slowly,  stirring constantly.   It may seem like it's not coming together - but it will!   As you cook it will come to a clam chowder consistency and look something like the picture below :
