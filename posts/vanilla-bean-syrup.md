This is a recipe that is well known in my family! I would HIGHLY recommend that you try and use the best vanilla you can get your hands on. We have a container of vanilla bean paste that makes this incredible!

* 1 cup sugar
* 1/2 cup buttermilk
* 1/2 cup (1 square) butter
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1 1/2 tsp vanilla (paste or really good extract)

1. Add sugar, buttermilk, butter, and baking soda and turn stove to medium-high.
2. Continue to stir mixture and make sure the bottom isn't getting burned.
3. Once boil begins, add vanilla and keep stirring. Take syrup off heat and serve once it has cooled a little.   
     
   ENJOY!
