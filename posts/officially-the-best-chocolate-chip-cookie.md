As someone who has tried a lot of chocolate chip recipes... I think this one wins in every possible way. With under baking these you create the perfect texture of a little crunch on the outside and a warm gooey center. These taste amazing day after as well!  
  
INGREDIENTS

* 1 cup unsalted butter - soft
* 1 cup white granulated sugar
* 1 cup light brown sugar - packed
* 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
* 2 eggs
* 3 cups flour
* 1 tsp baking soda
* 1/2 tsp baking powder
* 1 tsp sea salt
* 2 cups chocolate chips (I used semi-sweet)

INSTRUCTIONS

* Preheat oven to 375
* Cream butter, white & brown sugar
* Add in eggs and vanilla until creamy and fluffy
* Add dry ingredients slowly to incorporate
* Add chocolate chips
* Make cookie dough balls onto a sheet or use a cookie scoop to your desired size
* Bake in oven for 9 - 11 minutes until brown is just barely coming in. The cookies will look under baked but that is what will make them taste so good! TRUST THE UNDERDONE COOKIE!
* Let them cool for a minute or two until moved to a cooling rack.
* ENJOY!
