This has been a really fun project to set up! We have wanted a way for our group to be able to make posts and share either technical or food recipes. The entire source code for this project is hosted on GitHub - [https://github.com/BenDaSpur/cwqe](https://github.com/BenDaSpur/cwqe "https://github.com/BenDaSpur/cwqe")

So for some basics the site is running on [Svelte ]()for the front-end and [Sapper ]()for the routing/back-end. Svelte came out with v3 and I think it is really intuitive for web development and Sapper makes the project into a server side rendered (SSR) website.  
  
In terms of how we create content, currently it is using [Forestry.io](https://forestry.io/) and creates each post in markdown. This is a nice ability to have a simple CMS where we can produce new recipes!
