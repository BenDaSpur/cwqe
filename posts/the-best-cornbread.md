* 1 Cup Buttermilk
* 2 Eggs
* 1/2 Cup Melted Butter

Mix these ingredients until well combined. Then in another bowl add the following:

* 1 Cup Cornmeal
* 1 Cup Flour
* 2/3 Cup Sugar
* 1.5 Tsp Baking Powder
* 0.5 Tsp Baking Soda
* Pinch of salt

Then combine the liquids into the solids and slowly fold mixture until well incorporated. Grab a cast iron skillet and rub some butter on the skillet until cast iron has decent coating. Pour mixture into skillet and place into oven at 350 for about 25 minutes or until top is golden brown and toothpick comes out clean in center. Serve with honey butter!

Honey butter is simple - about equal parts honey and butter!  
  
This is a recipe that I love to put inside my Traeger when my main dish is almost finished cooking. Gives it a nice smokey flavor to go along with the protein!
