This recipe started when we needed a new finger food for a brunch party we were attending. Typically we knew that brunch parties with this particular group tended to be heavy on carbs and light on anything else, so we decided to try out some meatball. Searing the meatballs the night before and then letting them slowly simmer in fresh barbecue sauce for most of the next morning left the house smelling fantastic and me tempted to sneak a few before the party got started. Thankfully, they didn't disappoint and we've used this recipe ever since!

Recipe to follow once I can remember it (I cook by feel and need to make them again so I can write down what I do...)
