SQE vs QA

When I was given the reins of the Quality organization at my current company we were called 'IT Quality Assurance'. The ‘IT’ was necessary to differentiate us from the Service Center (Call Center) Quality Assurance team. (Side note, this didn’t really work. I still got misdirected requests from that QA team because people were confused)

I’ve struggled with the term QA for a while. It’s a standard descriptor for the quality and testing function of software development. The term will never go away. I'm at peace with that and I still use it generically and in mixed company. But I don’t think it describes what we do – or what we *should* be doing – of what we aspire to be.

"QA" has a connotation of a check off process at the end of the creation of software. It’s waterfall at its finest. This view of quality makes us gate keepers. It put undue pressure on one step of the SDLC to identify quality problems. You are the last step between that code and the ever looming production release date. It puts a wall between software development and software testing. It's a ridiculous wall when you think about it too. Testing isn't a job title. It's an activity that we do when we develop software. Everyone tests.

Also, we can’t really "assure" anything. Testing after the fact can't do a single thing about presence of bugs. Testing can never assure the absence of bugs.

I believe our mission is build the processes and tools that to lead the team to a more mature quality culture.

"Engineers" build things.

"Assurers" - if there even is such a thing – dang, I dunno, I guess check things? And try to give the illusion that we are doing a quality job with our software.

This might seem like a simple issue of semantics but I feel like it's absolutely necessary to shift the mindset of what we mean when we talk about software quality.

So, as soon as I was given the opportunity, I changed the name to Software Quality Engineering. It gets shortened to SQE. "Squeeee", as one of my developers pointed out, is the sound a pig makes.

And the pig mascot was born.
