_NOTE:_

This is a 'reprint' of an article I wrote for my first testing blog MANY MOONS AGO.

The original content posted with this PDF was very specific to my company at the time - as is some of the content within the PDF. 

The idea of exploratory testing was brand new to my team in 2010.  We all _did_ exploratory testing - but no one could name it or why it was different than scripted.  Nor was there any idea around writing test charters or even capturing what happened when we were exploring software.
