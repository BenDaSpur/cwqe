* 250g of plain flour
* 1 teaspoon of baking powder
* 1 teaspoon of salt
* 3 ripe bananas
* 1 tablespoon of milk
* 110g of butter
* 200g of sugar
* 2 eggs
* 1 bag of chocolate chips

Combine and bake it for about 70 minutes on 170 C!

I found this recipe on Reddit a while back and have found great success with it! This recipe doesn't turn the bread dark like most because it uses baking powder and no soda!  
  
Everyone who has a bite will think it's the best they have had!
