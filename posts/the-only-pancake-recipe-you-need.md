* 2 ½ cups all-purpose flour
* 3 tablespoons sugar
* 2 teaspoons kosher salt
* 1 teaspoon baking powder
* 1 teaspoon baking soda
* 2 ½ cups buttermilk
* 8 tablespoons unsalted butter, 1 stick, melted
* 2 eggs, whites and yolks separated
* 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, plus more for serving
* blueberry, optional

Now I am not a major fan of facebook videos especially because I think most baking recipes are fake but this one was an instant success. This continues to be one of the most requested recipes to make for breakfast.  
  
STEPS

1. In large bowl add the flour, salt, baking powder & soda, and whisk to incoorporate
2. In a medium bowl add the buttermilk, melted butter, and egg YOLKS and whisk to combine.
3. Add buttermilk mixture to dry ingredients and gently fold until just combined
4. Add the egg whites and fold until just combined. Do not over mix. It is okay for the mixture to have some lumps
5. Let the batter sit for 30+ minutes. It will be worth the wait!

COOKING TIPS

* Before adding batter to a skillet make sure to have plenty of butter down first
* Cook on a lower temperature. These are thicker and need lower heat to cook the middle without burning the outside
* Make sure you have nothing else going on afterwards. You are going to want a nap.
