_NOTE:_

This is a 'reprint' of an article I wrote for my first testing blog MANY MOONS AGO. 

I'm going to be including a few of my older posts here with some updated commentary

I wrote this at the beginning of my journey,  quest, if you will,  to change the perception that Dev and QA are somehow adversarial.  This sentiment flows into my love for the [https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/modern-testing-principles/](https://www.angryweasel.com/ABTesting/modern-testing-principles/ "Modern Testing Principles") - more to come on that in a future post.

Original Post:

Original post date was : FRIDAY, OCTOBER 29, 2010

It was recently suggested to me that QA folk are 'evil'. Evil on the order of BEELZEBUB. Evil... on the order of Sith Lords. For those reading this that need a little extra help - this would be the bad guys in Star Wars.  
  
Now, of course this was in jest - but it brought up some interesting points that I'd like to explore.  
  
With all of the accusations that we like to throw back and forth between teams of wrong doing - which team, Dev or QA (and including Support here), really is closer to being in tune with the Dark Side of the Force?  
  
The incident which spurred this conversation had something to do with my unfortunate glee in finding a bug one day. (I really don't intend it to come across that way. I was happy to have done a good job in my QA sphere - not delighting in having discovered a deficiency. - this really needs to be a blog post all of it's own, though. I digress... )  
  
  
Development likes to view themselves has brave Jedi masters - fearlessly slaying requirements with their brilliantly written code. They are knights - they are heros. They are the true Jedi and must get their pure code past the Evil process and scrutiny of the QA Lords. QA sits at their desk cackling as they rack up the bug count to meet the bug quota that on one will admit exists. (It doesn't exist) QA taps the ends of their fingers together as they devise new and painful rules to impose in the name of structure and 'process'. QA is pure evil.  
  
QA (and our Support friends) will counter we are the true Jedi because that we have to defend the universe from evil bugs in the code. We must find the issues before they would reach an end user and thus destroy peace in the galaxy. We must ensure that Development does not attempt to use their mind tricks to divert us from asking for the required documentation. Development, in this view, sits shrouded in mystery in dark rooms spinning spaghetti code and unrealistic release dates. All the while, slipping in 'just one more feature' that must be tested without affecting the deadline.   
  
  
So where is the score? Who really are the evil ones here? Who really deserves to be the true Sith lords and who gets to be the Jedi's?   
  
The answer should be clear.  
  
  
  
NEITHER!  
  
  
 WE ARE ON THE SAME DARN TEAM. We are not fighting against each other. We are all Jedi (or maybe all Siths...depending on the mood we're in). In the end we all contributed to the destruction Death Star and we all get to party with the Ewoks.  
  
So, let's save our energy to and focus on the real evil in our midst - 3rd Party Vendors, Auditors... and occasionally Project Management (sorry guys...;))  
  
Since today is Halloween I 've decided that the team we ALL are on is the Dark Side - So... with that in mind... if you're in the office today come by my desk... we have cookies!
