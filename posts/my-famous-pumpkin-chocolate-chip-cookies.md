## THE BOMB DOT COM OF COOKIES

I accidentally created this recipe while following another recipe and accidentally adding too much pumpkin to the mixture. What followed was a pretty damn good pumpkin chocolate chip cookie.

Recipe:

1 15oz can of pumpkin puree  
1 Egg  
1/2 C Vegetable Oil  
1 C Sugar  
1 T Vanilla

2 C flour  
2 tsp baking powder
2 tsp cinnamon (more to taste)
1/2 tsp salt
1 tsp baking soda
2 C semi-sweet chocolate chips

1. Start oven at 350 degrees
2. Combine first part (liquids) into medium bowl until well incorporated.
3. Combine second part (dry) into bigger bowl and mix ingredients.
4. Pour wet bowl and slowly mix into dry bowl. (Don't overmix)
5. When mixture is ready, create cookie mounds on cookie sheet that either has parchment paper or a silicone mat on it
6. Bake the cookies for about 10-14 minutes. The key is to not overbake them but to underbake them just barely so they are still soft for the days after!
