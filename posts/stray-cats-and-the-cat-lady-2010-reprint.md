**_Original Post:_**

I coined what I *think* is a new term this week - Stray cat apps.  
  
You know... those mangy apps (or servers, *sigh*) that **no one** wants to work on. Every so often I go to my door and find another one there... sad and starved. The little wretches have been kicked around the team from developer to developer or from QA to QA until some poor sap takes pity and starts feeding them. After a while those cats become yours.   
  
I think we all have accumulated one or two of these beasts. But lately I'm starting to feel like maybe I've let myself become the crazy cat lady...
