Here it is. The one that will make your family ask for these every weekend. This recipe paired with my [vanilla syrup](/recipes/vanilla-bean-syrup) will be something that gets talked about for weeks to come!

* 2 cups warm milk (100 - 115 degrees)
* 1/2 cup butter - melted
* 1 tsp sugar
* 1/2 cup warm water (100 - 115 degrees)
* 1 package (1/4 ounce) active dry yeast
* 2 large eggs - room temp
* 2 & 3/4 cups all purpose flour
* 1 tsp salt
* 1/2 tsp baking soda

1. In a large mixing bowl, add yeast into warm water. Add sugar then let sit for about 5 minutes. Add milk, butter, and eggs. After ingredients have been incorporated add flour and salt. Mix and then cover batter and put it in the fridge overnight.
2. The next morning add the baking soda then use batter in waffle iron.

Make sure to use my vanilla bean syrup recipe to have the best brunch!
