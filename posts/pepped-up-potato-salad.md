* Another boost to a recipe that so many people already have. I present the new recipe that you will need when you want to make the best potato salad. This features using soaked mustard and celery seed. This gives such great flavor!

  Soak overnight:
* 1 1/2 tsp mustard seed
* 1 tsp celery seed
* 3 Tbls vinegar

* 1 1/2 tsp salt
* 1/2 cup finely chopped green onions & tops
* 5 cups diced cooked potatoes
* 3/4 cup mayonnaise or salad dressing
* 2 chopped hard cooked eggs (I use almost double but to each their own!)

1. Soak seeds in vinegar overnight
2. Add seeds to bowl of cooked & cut potatoes and mix lightly as to not smash potatoes
3. Add mayonnaise, onions, and chopped eggs and toss to incorporate
4. Chill thoroughly, trim with hard cooked egg wedges and paprika to taste!
