What do you do when you have a small training budget and an awesome QE team?  You stage your on personal in house "Stay Conference".  A conference dedicated to enhancing your abilities from the comforts of your own home.  (Or maybe after the corona virus stuff is all over, in the comforts of an awesome conference room with catered lunch.)

There's lots to do!

* Ted Talks, virtually broadcasted speakers from conferences and more can be used to increase the variety of your events.


* Give a couple of your members a book and have them do a presentation on what they read.  
* Let the members discover new technologies and use this to present how they can be used to make your work more efficient.


* Personality quizes, getting to know you games or team building excercises will get your team together and have stronger bonds.
* This is your chance to get on your soap box in front of a captive audience.
* Go wild and Go Creative!
