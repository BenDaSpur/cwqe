## Corissa's Cabbage Crap

Some iteration of this recipe exists in many, many families, but Corissa is the first person I know to actually bring it to a work lunch, so there is no way we couldn't include it on the website as one of our premier recipes:

Recipe:

* Cabbage, chopped fine, in whatever quantity desired
* 1/4C-1/2C Oil (match this to the quantity of cabbage and don't make it soggy!)
* 1/4C-1/2C Vinegar (see oil instructions above)
* Salt to taste
* Pepper to taste

Don't make the cabbage soggy! That's really the key to this recipe as other than that you'll use all of the ingredients to taste.

**Variations**!

You can use any sort of oil or vinegar you like for this. 

Olive oil and balsamic vinegar

Sesame oil and rice wine vinegar

Any flavored oil + white vinegar
